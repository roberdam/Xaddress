# XADDRESS
Give 7 billion people an instant physical address that can be used offline and decoded with low tech (pen & paper).

## How it works.

Xaddress encodes the latitude & longitude of a place in a form that resembles a normal address and can be decoded back easily even in a low tech environment using paper, pen and a physical map.

## Demo

The demo site uses some free apis with limited requests per day,
some functionality might be unavailable on high demand.

## Features
![parts] (https://github.com/roberdam/Xaddress/blob/master/images/parts.png)

####            1) VISUAL AVATAR
Used like a visual hash to ensure that you write the Xaddress right, if you change any letter it will generate another image, for example MAGICAL PEARL**S** will show you a different image so you can know that you write a wrong address.

If you want to transmit your Xaddress by phone you will say
>    "7150 MAGICAL PEARL - Maluku ,Indonesia"   my avatar is a boot

####            2) COUNTRY AND STATE
You can see right away the country and state where that Xaddress is located, and you can recognize it as an address.

####            3) SHORT CODE
By default Xaddress create 2 kind of codes, each one independent from the other, the short code can be decoded by itself, it can have 1 meter accuracy, and is useful to storage or send it as a link, like [ubicate.me/NOMATAL-KOROFAD](http://ubicate.me/NOMATAL-KOROFAD)

## Encoding with the Ruby CLI.
Now to get started with Xaddress you would perform the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/roberdam/Xaddress.git
cd Xaddress
bundle
ruby encode.rb "-6.7184,129.5080"
```

You can use it without using geocoder by specify state and country in the command line:
```
ruby encode.rb "-6.7184,129.5080" "Maluku, Indonesia"
```
## Decoding with the Ruby CLI.
```
ruby decode.rb "7150 MAGICAL PEARL - Maluku, Indonesia"
```

## PROS:

* Instantaneous.
* Offline
* Designed to be used in low tech environments
* Multilanguage
* Error correction incorporated with visual avatar.
* Short code for storing or linking.
* Works with any map.
* Yow know is an address when you see it.


## CONS:
* May take you some effort to find a suitable address
* 10mts accuracy with the present form.
